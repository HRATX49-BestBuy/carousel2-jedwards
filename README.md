Product Carousel 2

This is one of the 3 components I made for the front end capstone project I completed at Hack Reactor.  In all I ended up creating 3 carousels and the footer component.

In this project I led a team of 3 other software engineers who completed the navbar, product display image, and the reviews section of the Best Buy website.  Together we had 3 weeks to replicate a product page so that it would match Best Buys design as closely as possible.  The project had to also match functionality of the components we were replicating.
